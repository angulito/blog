# Secret activities and small tips about Krakow

## Wawel's Castle

These castle's gardens and squares are very beautiful, and free to see!

I highly recommend you to visit this castle on Monday if you are available, because it's [free](https://wawel.krakow.pl/en/hours-tickets-reservations-luggage) to access to the _Crown Treasury and Armoury_ and _The Lost Wawel_ (keep in mind the rest of castle's zones will be closed), and if you like the visit you can come back another day and pay for the new zones you want to visit.

Note: Although it's free, you will need to go to the ticketing point to get and print your free tickets.

## Old town free tour

In Rynek Główny (Main Square) there are a lot of old town free tours around 10am. I highly recommend you the [White Umbrella tour](https://whiteumbrellatours.com/krakow-tours/free-walking-tour-krakow/) (they wear a white umbrella, according to their name). I saw them in the part of the [artistic statue Rzeźba Mitoraja](https://goo.gl/maps/6tssN5hbFZsEepFp7).

## <u>[Cybermachina Game Pub](https://goo.gl/maps/noiEdUwBfB97SxQ38)</u>

This is a cool place to go after having dinner in order to play to board games, football table or even to play guitar hero with your couple or friends. You just need to drink something (it is inexpensive, for example a homemade lemonade costs 5 PLN) and you can be there all the time you want. You need to ask to the barman the accessories or board games you want to use and leave your ID (you will get it back once you return the borrowed games).

Recommendation: Pica-picachu lemonade and Charmander orangeade, delicious and with a good price!

## <u>[Walk around the castle renting an electric scooter](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wawel+Royal+Castle/@50.0528882,19.933309,20.82z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47165b6d053619f5:0xacb9dfc4d67fa598!8m2!3d50.0540495!4d19.9354123)</u>

Something I really enjoyed every evening is to rent an electric scooter (there are many in Krakow) and enjoy the breeze around the Castle. Here you can find a pedestrian walkway and a bike ride along the river with a wonderful views of Krakow.

## <u>[Cinema city Galeria Kazimiert](https://goo.gl/maps/Kw9b1xJfqTqxVNJ37)</u>

In raining days (a very frequent day in Poland), you can enjoy an original version film (they usually don't dub films to Polish so it's very easy to watch an english film).

On the outskirts of the Kazimiert shopping center there are a bunch of food trucks, a precious fountain and hammocks (even you can go with kids because there are a park area to jump and play). It is worth taking a look at this area!

![gallery](/trips/krakow/gallery.jpg)

## <u>[Visit the Wieliczka salt mine](https://goo.gl/maps/2J9qowzcsb17h56W7)</u>

It was the best excursion we did. The tour lasted about 2.5 hours and it was awesome and super funny with the guidance we had (Agatha, in case you can choose).

![wieliczka](/trips/krakow/wieliczka.jpg)

**Recommendations about what to bring:**

- Small backpack (you can't carry a big backpack).
- Water.
- Money if you want to buy a souvenir inside the mines.
- Something for entertainment (in case you need to wait before entering).

Also, around the mines there are a beautiful park where you can walk around and wait quietly reading a book.

**How to arrive:**

We used Google Maps and we took a direct bus from the Jubilat stop.

- Bus: 304
- Time: ~30min
- Cost: 4.60PLN per person. **Important**: Carry coins, because sometimes the NFC credit card lector does not work. Also have in mind the machine to get the bus tickets is inside the bus (in the back part).

## <u>[Interactive science park (Ogród Doświadczeń im. Stanisława Lema)](https://g.page/ogroddoswiadczenkrakow?share)</u>

We had an awesome afternoon, it is highly recommended for kids and adults. It has many experiments and interactive games, so we recommend to go with time in order to enjoy all of them. Time went by pretty fast! We spend a couple of hours and we needed more time.

You can see timetables and prices in [the website](https://www.ogroddoswiadczen.pl/ticket-prices-od).

![science](/trips/krakow/science.jpg)

## <u>[Krakus mound](https://goo.gl/maps/QwBD32MvdpdGpPVq8)</u>

Wonderful place to go with your couple or friends to spend all the afternoon and evening there. The views and pictures are very beautiful.

Recommendations to bring:

- Towel, to lie on the grass.
- Water and non-alcoholic beverage.
- Deck of cards, games or book.

![krakus](/trips/krakow/krakus.jpg)

## <u>[Views from the Music Academy. Metrum Rooftop Restobar](https://goo.gl/maps/qBt1JAxr9X4jK5RA7)</u>

This place is a real secret. Cheap food and drink, and a wonderful views of Krakow city.

This bar is on the 6th floor of [Krakow Music Academy](https://goo.gl/maps/8uy8rKnFnmSBjfVv5).

Recommendations:

- You can taste a typical beverage from Poland, [Kompot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompot).

![music](/trips/krakow/music.jpg)

## <u>[Escape Room (in english)](http://exitgame.pl/en/select-the-room/)</u>

We are fans of escape rooms in Spain, and we decided to play the Cracow Beast room (Exit Game Combinator company). We were only 2 people and we read it would be better to do the Cracow Beast room instead other ones. Following the escape room comments from people, this room seems to be easier than the Pirate Ship room (but we didn't try the latter).

The [Cracow Beast room](http://exitgame.pl/en/cracow-beasts-2/) has a great setting and it is very automated (it is not only padlocks). Even the price is very good (when we were there it costed 100PLN for 2 people).

# Activities which other people recommends to do in Krakow

## Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps

This visit disappointed me. It's good to go and have a look at the concentration campos but it was not the best excursion of my life. One thing which could help me to enjoy more from the visit would be to know:

- [Buy the guidance tour](https://visit.auschwitz.org/?lang=en) well in advance.
- Auschwitz is just the concentration camp name, nto the village where you need to go. The village name is Oświęcim.
- **Don't wear big backpack**. You cannot enter with them and you will need to pay 4PLN to leave them in the luggage store. This is an idea of the [allowed size](https://www.decathlon.com/products/country-walking-backpack-10l-nh100?adept-product=country-walking-backpack-10l-nh100&variant=30301668606014&adept_product_id=country-walking-backpack-10l-nh100&source=search) that you can enter (approximately).
- **You need to pay to go to the toilet**. Yes, as you are reading, you need to pay 4PLN to go to the toilet.
- The <u>[entrance to Auschwitz concentration camp is by the museum](https://goo.gl/maps/Rxw1YqmkZbe21fx89)</u>.
- You need to arrive to the Auschwitz concentration camp at least 15 minutes before starting your tour because you need to go through a security control before entering (it is like the airports security control).
- Most of people go in bus because the bus stop is in front of the museum entrance. It means that it will be very busy when you go out of your Auschwitz visit. Have in mind you can also take a train although you will need to walk around 20 minutes to the train station. We bought the train tickets from the [web](https://bilety.polregio.pl/en/wyniki/85/146/18-09-2019_06:00/*/departure/all/all/auto).

## Kazimiert tour (Jewish quarter)

We did a free tour that we found in Rynek Główny, the main square, but we were disappointed because we walked a lot and the explanation was very poor. We recommend you to dig into this neighbor by yourself and you can follow some food tips (we found the best food places here) that we will give you above in this post.

# Best food places in Krakow

## \[Pierogis\] <u>[Przystanek Pierogarnia](https://goo.gl/maps/RUVKGjsum1zkkFfa6)</u>

Small place where you can eat delicious and cheap Pierogis.

## \[Typical Krakow donuts\] <u>[Stara Pączkarnia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZCZm2KqBBgU55rn6A)</u>

Irresistible sweet. They are like donuts. Even you can choose Kinder Bueno filled donut... And they are big and cheap by only 4PLN.

![donut](/trips/krakow/donut.jpg)

## \[Cake and coffee\] <u>[Czarodziej](https://goo.gl/maps/Rwgq8FLt7NJbTYjh7)</u>

This place is perfect to take a coffee (latte coffee is very good) and a piece of cake. However, you will need to point to the cake you want if you don't know to speak Polish, because they don't speak english!

![coffee](/trips/krakow/coffee.jpg)

## \[Soupes\] <u>[Morskie Oko](https://goo.gl/maps/qDDSgTT28WxxBDni9)</u>

This place is not cheap or expensive, but it's worth to go because you can eat a good traditional Krakow soup (inside a bread) or a delicious tomato soup.

![morskie](/trips/krakow/morskie.jpg)

## \[Special Ice Creams (kürtőskalács)\] <u>[Chimney Cake Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/RzMkwANWLKJYvbnZA)</u>

There are multiple Chimney Cake Bakery in Krakow, but in particular I've put the link to one which is in a foodtrucks place because I am gonna recommend you another near place to have lunch / dinner in these foodtruck place.

![chimney](/trips/krakow/chimney.jpg)

This ice cream shop is special because the ice cream is on a kürtőskalác. A kürtőskalác is a hungarian sweet like a cylinder and they cook it in the oven / fire. I highly recommend you to taste it, with ice cream or without it.

![kürtőskalács](/trips/krakow/kürtőskalács.jpg)

## \[Food truck: meatloaf's sandwich\] <u>[Andrus Food Truck - Maczanka Krakowska](https://goo.gl/maps/fjcteET2ELhkMHVUA)</u>

Meatloaf's sandwich cooked at low temperature in the oven. Delicious. And of course, for the desert, a kürtőskalác with ice cream! One of them that we recommend you in the previous tip.

## \[Georgian food - Very delicious and with a good price \] <u>[Smaki Gruzji](https://goo.gl/maps/1qM7fPnmasUsWUjk8)</u>

This is a lovely place to eat. You can find like a pizza, called Iberia, which is delicious. We repeated multiple times this place, because it was one of our favorites!

![georgian](/trips/krakow/georgian.jpg)
![georgian bill](/trips/krakow/georgian2.jpg)

## \[Traditional Polish food\] <u>[Kuchnia u Doroty](https://goo.gl/maps/1qwUxpsmW7EDUfj88)</u>

You will likely wait for some minutes to get a table. Don't be nervous, it is fast and it's worth. This place has a peculiar decoration and the food is very good. If you want to taste traditional polish food good and cheap, this is a good place.

We recommend the wheat beer, it was very tasty in this place...

## \Zapiekanki's square - Typical Polish Panini\] <u>[Plaza Zapiekanki](https://goo.gl/maps/A8i5kJrYhezLs4gj9)</u>

The Zapiekanki is a fast food and very typical from Poland (also it's super cheap). The Google Maps link from the title will direct you to the new square (plac Nowy) where you can find a lot of places to buy Zapiekanki. The Zapiekanki is very big, so if you are hungry you will be able to eat one of them, otherwise, you can share it with friends! In addition, this is one of the few places that closes later than most of the places (it's habitual to close around 9-10pm).

![zapiekanki](/trips/krakow/zapiekanki.jpg)

## \[Knuckle\] <u>[Pod Wawelem Kompania Kuflowa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/18K2orrCyjjVjzkb6)</u>

This restaurant is opposite to the Wawel's castle. Recommendations and things to keep in mind:

- The beer is extremly big, when they say to you a big beer, it's a 1 litter beer.
- A knuckle, at least the one we aet, weights around 1.2Kg, so it's enough for 2 or even more people. Be careful with ordering a lot of food! However, you can always ask them to put the rest of the food to take away.
  - The knuckle we ordered and it's delicious is called _Crispy pork knuckle_.

![Wawelem](/trips/krakow/wawelem.jpg)
![Wawelem bill](/trips/krakow/wawelem2.jpg)

## \[Brunch\] <u>[Ranny Ptaszek](https://goo.gl/maps/7uHVUECkSpew9CAV8)</u>

This is a small place but it's good to drink an orange juice and a small casserole with sauce and sausages (although there are more options). Perfect for a brunch.

![brunch](/trips/krakow/brunch.jpg)

## \[American breakfast\] <u>[Alchemia od Kuchni](https://g.page/AlchemiaOdKuchni?share)</u>

Big breakfasts with an American style (sausages, eggs...).

![american breakfast](/trips/krakow/american_breakfast.jpg)

# Tips to come back to your home

If you are traveling in airport, it would be interesting to know that there is a free area in the Krakow Airport where you can play to football table, ping-pong or a big chess. It's very funny and very comfortable to wait for your trip there (before passing the security control). It's located in the 1st floor.

![airport](/trips/krakow/airport.jpg)

Some ideas about what to bring to the plane:

- boiled eggs
- empty water bottle (you can fill it once you pass the security control)
- sandwich
- snacks
- game console
- book
- deck of cards
